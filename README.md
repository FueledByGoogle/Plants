An IOS app to track your daily expenses.


## Goals:

- [] Pie chart showing percentage current day/week/month expenses in different categories
- [] Manul entry and saving of data onto local database of user expenses
- [] Overview of expenditure based on user filter such as day/month/year
- [] Search history for a specific date


## Current progress: 

- Custom pie chart drawn from data
- Simple database that is searchable
- Using Google's ML API to recognize text from picture ( plan is to use this in the future read from a grocery receipt and categorize expenditure; however,  many items are abbrevieated and inconsistent across s tores )
