# Pocket

An IOS app to track your daily expenses. All UI designed programmatically rather than using Apple's visual interface builder storyboard.


## Todo (In order of priority):

- Draw my own UI icons
- Choose custom date for pie view


## Bugs:

- Highlighted calendar cell text colour not reverting back correctly upon switching to another month while date picker tool is up


## Currently Completed: 
- Calendar view which users can choose different months of the year, and specific date to view epxneses
- Swipe to delete single entries from calendar view
- Edit an existing entry from calendar view
- User can choose a date, amount, to enter into database
- Custom pie chart drawn from data that dynamically assigns a colour to a category, and displayed along with a chart legend.
- Update pie chart view based on filter of current day, week, month, or year.
- Consistent dark/light mode colour switching

## Improvements:
- Refresh table view in calendar tab after user edits entry, this provides smoother looking animation
