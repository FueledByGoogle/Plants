# Pocket

An IOS app to track your daily expenses. All UI designed programmatically rather than using Apple's visual interface builder storyboard.


## Current Work In Progress:

- Choose custom date for pie view
- Draw my own UI icons 


## Currently Completed: 
- Calendar view which users can choose different months of the year, and specific date to view epxneses
- Swipe to delete single entries from calendar view
- User can choose a date, amount, to enter into database
- Custom pie chart drawn from data that dynamically assigns a colour to a category, and displayed along with a chart legend.
- Update pie chart view based on filter of current day, week, month, or year.
